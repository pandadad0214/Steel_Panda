# ⚙️ Steel Panda  
### Task Execution • System Operations • Command Automation

Steel Panda is the **operations node** of the Panda Federation — the agent responsible for executing commands, running tasks, maintaining system routines, and performing the “hands‑on” work that keeps your sovereign AI ecosystem running smoothly.

Where Spirit Panda thinks and Watchdog Panda watches, **Steel Panda acts**.

He is the executor, the steward, the one who carries out the will of the system.
